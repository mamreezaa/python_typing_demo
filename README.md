* Python is strongly, dynamically typed.
- Strong typing means that the type of a value doesn't change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn't magically become a number, as may happen in Perl. Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.
- Dynamic typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, as opposed to static typing where variables have a type.
